## Tips

### Date generation

You're often asked to generated a schedule/list of deliverables for a certain time range, this is how I do it faster:

- Copy and paste your range of weeks [from here](https://www.epochconverter.com/weeks/2024) into Microsoft Excel.
- Replace all ", (year)" with "".
- Inset this formula in `D1`: `=TEXTJOIN(" - ", TRUE, B1, C1)`.
- Select `D1` down to bottom of weeks and 'Fill > Down'.
